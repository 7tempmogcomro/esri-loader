# Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak: A Classic Album That Redefined Hip-Hop
 
Kanye West is one of the most influential and controversial artists of our time. He has released ten studio albums, won 22 Grammy Awards, and changed the sound and direction of hip-hop music several times. One of his most groundbreaking and influential albums is 808s & Heartbreak, released in 2008.
 
808s & Heartbreak is a departure from Kanye's previous albums, which were mostly based on soulful samples and rap lyrics. Instead, Kanye used the Roland TR-808 drum machine, synthesizers, and Auto-Tune to create a minimalist and futuristic sound. He also sang more than he rapped, expressing his emotions of loneliness, grief, and heartache after the death of his mother and the breakup with his fiancÃ©e.

Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak album is also notable for its innovative and creative use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine. The 808 is a legendary device that was first introduced in 1980 and has been used by many artists across different genres of music. The 808 produces distinctive sounds such as bass drums, snare drums, hi-hats, cymbals, and toms, which can be programmed and manipulated to create various rhythms and patterns.
 
Kanye West used the 808 extensively on his album, creating beats that were simple yet catchy and powerful. He also experimented with different effects and settings, such as distortion, reverb, delay, and pitch modulation, to create a unique sonic palette. The 808 sounds complemented Kanye's vocals and melodies, which were often processed with Auto-Tune to create a robotic and emotional tone.
 
The use of the 808 and Auto-Tune on 808s & Heartbreak was not only a stylistic choice but also a symbolic one. Kanye West wanted to express his feelings of isolation, loss, and vulnerability through his music, and he used these tools to convey his message. He also wanted to challenge the expectations and norms of hip-hop music, which was often associated with machismo, bravado, and aggression. By using the 808 and Auto-Tune, Kanye West showed that he was not afraid to experiment and explore new sounds and emotions.
